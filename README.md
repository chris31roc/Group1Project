## Description
- Have you ever thought to yourself, “what am I going to eat for dinner?”,  and or “what am I going to watch?” There’s food and ingredients in the house, but you may not be a Michelin 3 star chef to come up with something dynamic and delicious. So many movie channels and streaming apps, but you can’t decide on what to watch. Look no further because there’s an app for that too. What this app will do is take a list of ingredients that are input and the app will generate a list of dishes that you can make. From sauces to full course meals. Now, let’s make it date night! Movie theaters closed? That’s ok, because with each recipe generated, a recommended movie will be paired with the meal!
