# Team Chopp’d

- Have you ever thought to yourself, “what am I going to eat for dinner?” There’s food and ingredients in the house, but you may not be a Michelin 3 star chef to come up with something dynamic and delicious. Look no further because there’s an app for that too. What this app will do is take a list of ingredients that are input and the app will generate a list of dishes that you can make. From sauces to full course meals. You may also be wondering what adult beverage you’ll be having with your meal, again the app has you covered. Input what type of spirit you like and a few beverages will generate.
